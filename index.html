            Introduction

                <ul>
                    <li>Attention Getter: Have you ever gotten a spam email or text message before?  Typically, they say you have won some large amount of money or that something is wrong with your device and you should download their free “anti-virus” software. The moment you respond to any of those messages you notice your device starts to run slower or maybe your friends get those same weird messages coming from you now.</li>
                    <li>Audience Relevance: Everyone today has a device they use that can connect to the internet.  You use it for work, school, or for entertainment and because its so involved in our daily lives, its important to know how to protect yourself while using these devices.</li>
                    <li>Speaker Credibility: I am a computer science major who has a lot of interest in the cyber security department and I believe that everyone should be informed on the certain dangers of the internet.</li>
                    <li>Thesis: Learning about what cyber security is, the dangers of viruses, and how to better protect ourselves from them.</li>
                    <li>Preview of Main Points: First I will inform the audience of what is cyber security. Then I will explain and give examples to what a virus is. Finally, I will give guidelines for how to best protect yourself from a potential virus.</li>
                </ul>
