        <h1>Protecting People from Potential Cyber Problems</h1>

            Introduction
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attention Getter: Have you ever gotten a spam email or text message before?  Typically, they say you have won some large amount of money or that something is wrong with your device and you should download their free “anti-virus” software. The moment you respond to any of those messages you notice your device starts to run slower or maybe your friends get those same weird messages coming from you now.</li>
                    <li>Audience Relevance: Everyone today has a device they use that can connect to the internet.  You use it for work, school, or for entertainment and because its so involved in our daily lives, its important to know how to protect yourself while using these devices.</li>
                    <li>Speaker Credibility: I am a computer science major who has a lot of interest in the cyber security department and I believe that everyone should be informed on the certain dangers of the internet.</li>
                    <li>Thesis: Learning about what cyber security is, the dangers of viruses, and how to better protect ourselves from them.</li>
                    <li>Preview of Main Points: First I will inform the audience of what is cyber security. Then I will explain and give examples to what a virus is. Finally, I will give guidelines for how to best protect yourself from a potential virus.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            Transition to the first main point: This is just one of the many malicious malwares that spread around from device to device that can be easily prevented with the right steps but first we need to understand the importance of cyber security and by the end of the this you should have the knowledge to spot a virus and protect yourself.

            <li> Main Point 1
                <ul>
                    <li>Cyber security is a growing concern over the past decades and is something that is considered a national effort to practice safety.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cyber security can be defined as the practice of ensuring the integrability, confidentiality, and availability of information, a definition given by J.M. Porup, the Senior Writer at CSO, a news article dedicated at serving security decision-makers with the critical information they need to stay ahead of evolving threats and defense against criminal cyberattacks.</li>
                            <li>Staying ahead of cybercrime is an issue that all nations face, including the United States.  The aftermath of eight major cyber attacks in 2016, including one on the U.S. Department of Justice in which over twenty thousand FBI employee’s information got leaked, caused the National Security Agency’s deputy national manager for national security systems, Curt Dukes, to speak on the issue.  On October 16th, at the American Enterprise Institute, Dukes said that “…as a nation we have to rethink how we’re actually organized when we do cyber defense to protect the whole of the nation…”  In the DoD (Department of Defense) news article written by Amaani Lyle, Dukes mentions the length of time it takes to react to a cybercrime and that the system in place takes far too long to stop the hacker’s objective.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <h3>Transition: All this trouble probably came from a few lines of code and to understand how, we must first understand what a virus is.</h3>
            <li> Main Point 2
                <ul>
                    <li>So, what is a computer virus?  According to the Symantec Corporation, the world’s leading cyber security company supporting more than fifty million families via their Norton Security platform, it is “…much like a flu virus, (it) is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document.” Just like the flu there are multiple kinds and variations of viruses.
                        <ol>
                            <li>According to Dell’s customer support team, Dell being a global leading tech company, viruses can be categorized into nine different classes.  The most common two being malware and adware.  Malware is any type of software that can affect anyone’s device negatively and can gather a user’s personal data.  Adware is a software that randomly causes advertisements to pop up on to the user’s screen to generate revenue for its original owner.  Having advertisements pop up on the screen does not sound so bad since we are so used to it happening whenever we visit a website or using an app, so how bad can a virus actually be?</li>
                            <li>Computer viruses clearly do not get the same sickness as we do.  Their definition of a “cold” is slow performance, system crashing, and the losing of files.  Also, just like us, viruses are not the only sickness for them.  They can get computer worms, which essentially eat up all the bandwidth data making your internet seem really slow.  There are these things called Trojan horses, which just like in the history books just secretly wait inside your device until the right moment comes to steal your passwords.  Lastly there is spyware, which is like a worse version of adware, it still causing advertisements to pop up but now it has the ability to steal your credit card information. </li>
                        </ol>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <h3>Transition: So, what steps can we take to protect ourselves from these threats.</h3>
